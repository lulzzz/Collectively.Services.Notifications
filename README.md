**Collectively.Services.Notifications**
----------------

The **Collectively.Services.Notifications** is a service responsible for handling all user notifications. Thanks to this service the users can decide if they want to be notified about remark updates.

**Quick start**
----------------

## Docker way

Collectively is built as a set of microservices, therefore the easiest way is to run the whole system using the *docker-compose*.

Clone the [Collectively.Docker](https://github.com/noordwind/Collectively.Docker) repository and run the *start.sh* script:

```
git clone https://github.com/noordwind/Collectively.Docker
./start.sh
```

For the list of available services and their endpoints [click here](https://github.com/noordwind/Collectively).

## Classic way

In order to run the **Collectively.Services.Notifications** you need to have installed:
- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com)

Clone the repository and start the application via *dotnet run --no-restore* command:

```
git clone https://github.com/noordwind/Collectively.Services.Notifications
cd Collectively.Services.Notifications/Collectively.Services.Notifications
dotnet restore --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --source https://www.myget.org/F/collectively/api/v3/index.json --no-cache
dotnet run --no-restore --urls "http://*:10005"
```

Once executed, you shall be able to access the service at [http://localhost:10005](http://localhost:10005)

Please note that the following solution will only run the Notifications Service which is merely one of the many parts required to run properly the whole Collectively system.

**Configuration**
----------------

Please edit the *appsettings.json* file in order to use the custom application settings. To configure the docker environment update the *dockerfile* - if you would like to change the exposed port, you need to also update it's value that can be found within *Program.cs*.
For the local testing purposes the *.local* or *.docker* configuration files are being used (for both *appsettings* and *dockerfile*), so feel free to create or edit them.
